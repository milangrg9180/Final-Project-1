# Skills Route Removal Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed the `/student/skills` route and related functionality as requested. Skills management is now handled entirely through the CV creation and editing system with the new multiple search selection feature.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Skills Route** (`blueprints/student.py`)
- **Deleted**: `@student_bp.route('/skills', methods=['GET', 'POST'])` function
- **Removed**: `select_skills()` function (entire route handler)
- **Updated**: Dashboard logic to remove redirect to skills selection

### 2. **Updated Authentication Flow** (`blueprints/auth.py`)
- **Removed**: Skills check in login redirect logic
- **Simplified**: Student login now redirects directly to dashboard after CV check
- **Updated**: Login flow now only checks for CV existence, not skills

### 3. **Updated Student Dashboard** (`blueprints/student.py`)
- **Removed**: Redirect to skills selection when no skills are set
- **Added**: Comment noting that skills are now managed through CV creation

### 4. **Updated Student Profile Template** (`templates/student_profile.html`)
- **Removed**: Link to skills selection page
- **Updated**: Tip message to direct users to CV editing instead
- **Changed**: "Update your skills" link now points to CV editing

### 5. **Deleted Template File**
- **Removed**: `templates/select_skills.html` (no longer needed)

## New User Flow

### For Students:
1. **Login** → Check if CV exists
2. **If no CV** → Redirect to CV creation (with multiple search selection)
3. **If CV exists** → Redirect directly to dashboard
4. **Skills management** → Done through CV creation/editing with search selection

### Benefits:
- **Simplified workflow**: One less step in the user journey
- **Better UX**: Skills are managed in context with other CV information
- **Consistent data**: All student information in one place (CV)
- **Enhanced functionality**: Multiple search selection provides better skills management

## Technical Details

### Routes Removed:
- `GET /student/skills` - Skills selection page
- `POST /student/skills` - Skills update handler

### Templates Removed:
- `templates/select_skills.html`

### Database Impact:
- No database schema changes required
- Skills data continues to be stored in the `profiles` table
- CV skills data stored in the `cvs` table (new system)

## Testing Status

- ✅ CV view error fixed (datetime formatting issue resolved)
- ✅ Skills route completely removed

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Streamlined Process**: Students no longer need to manage skills separately
2. **Better Integration**: Skills are part of the comprehensive CV system
3. **Enhanced Selection**: Multiple search selection provides better skills management
4. **Consistent Interface**: All student data management through CV system

The skills route has been successfully removed and the application now provides a more streamlined experience where skills are managed as part of the CV creation and editing process.
